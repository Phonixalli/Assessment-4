    <p class="transparent-italic"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona" target="_blank">Bearded Dragons </a> are my favourite animal!</p>

        <li><strong>Origins</strong>
            <ul class="square-list">
                <li>Bearded dragons (scientific name: Pogona) are indigenous to Australia and are found predominantly in the arid and semi-arid regions of the continent. They are part of the diverse reptile fauna of Australia, which includes a wide variety of lizard species.</li>
                <li>Within Australia, bearded dragons have a wide distribution, spanning across various states and territories, including Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and parts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. They inhabit a range of habitats, from deserts to woodlands and scrublands.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        
            <li><strong>Appearance</strong>
                <ul class="square-list">
                    <li>Bearded dragons have a unique behavior where they puff out their throat, creating a "beard" of spiky scales. This display is often used as a form of communication, signaling dominance, submission, or even excitement.</li>
                    <li>Bearded dragons exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns, including shades of brown, tan, red, orange, and yellow. Additionally, their coloration can change based on factors such as mood, temperature, and health. Some bearded dragons even have patterns or markings that resemble other animals, such as leopard spots or tiger stripes.</li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
            
                <li><strong>Diet</strong>
                    <ul class="square-list">
                        <li>Bearded dragons are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant matter and animal protein. In the wild, their diet includes a variety of insects such as crickets, mealworms, and roaches, as well as leafy greens, vegetables, and fruits.</li>
                        <li>Bearded dragons have a unique feeding behavior known as "gaping." When hunting or feeding, they open their mouths wide to capture prey or grasp vegetation. This behavior is often accompanied by rapid tongue movements to capture insects or vegetation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
